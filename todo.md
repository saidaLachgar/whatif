    i built a platform where people can share their ideas for websites and apps , fostering creativity and innovation. It could also serve as a valuable resource for developers and entrepreneurs looking for new project ideas or opportunities to improve existing platforms. now am gonna lunch it but i need some data to start with so that the platform doesn't look empty. that's why i need u to give me 50 app ideas for different fields that can be an app or build by developer. ideas can be related to law, health, sports, tech.. anything. ideas should be creative and there is no platform providing it already. make this ideas like it's posted by people around the world and add hashtags. make it like people are wishing if there was a platform for it, for example some ne would post "i wish there is an app that will let me create a "shopping list" of stuff I need, then let me know when I'm near a place that sells it. For instance, I need speaker wire. I put speaker wire on my list, and the next time I'm out, I get an alert that says something like "you are within 1 mile of a Radio Shack and speaker wire is on your list, would you like to navigate to Radio Shack?"
